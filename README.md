# Statis-Pro-Hockey

As a hockey fan, I was happy to find out that there was a hockey version of the basbeball game I used to play as a kid (Statis Pro Baseball). Similarly, the game uses probability of NHL performance stats from individual players and teams to predict the outcome of the game using either multiplayer or rotisserie style of play. My idea was to try and make a computerized version of the game using Python. However, as i have started to develop the game, I have moved away from some of concepts and added some of my own. The game is far from complete, but does embody a working structure and can simulate games using default statistical values. There is still much to be done!

The game is intended to be played as a one to two players game, but ultimately, I want it to work as a purely AI tool to predict game outcomes. I have created multiple scripts that take into account various outcomes in a game, such as, line management, penalties, stamina, and shot potential. The main file that runs this is code is game_flow.py to which various functions are called depending on the outcome of a given result. 

My goal is to produce this game as a prediction tool, possibly using the implementation of nueral networks, such as LSTM. But for now the groundwork is being layed and is still a work in progress.
